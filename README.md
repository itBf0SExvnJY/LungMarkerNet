# Biomarker-Driven Image Classification for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Management

## Overview

This project presents a novel biomarker-driven image classification framework for enhancing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) management. It leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques tailored to extract and preserve critical anatomical and molecular information from medical images. By integrating biomarker insights with advanced imaging strategies, the framework aims to significantly improve clinical decision-making in oncology.

## Motivation

Traditional imaging strategies in NSCLC diagnosis suffer from:
- Low interpretability
- High sensitivity to noise
- Limited adaptability to emerging diagnostic protocols

To address these limitations, the project introduces a new methodology that aligns closely with biomarker-driven analysis and provides a more robust and precise classification pipeline.

## Methodology

The core architecture integrates two major components:

1. **Adaptive Radiological Transformer Network (ART-Net)**  
   - Incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism  
   - Embeds geometric priors to retain both anatomical and molecular structure

2. **Progressive Multi-Resolution Refinement Strategy (PMRRS)**  
   - Gradually guides the learning process from coarse to fine resolution  
   - Improves robustness and accuracy across heterogeneous clinical datasets

## Key Contributions

- A transformer-based pipeline that unifies anatomical and biomarker-specific features
- Superior reconstruction fidelity and classification accuracy over traditional models
- A scalable and generalizable framework for downstream NSCLC applications

## Experimental Validation

Experiments demonstrate:
- Enhanced tumor region reconstruction and detection
- Improved feature discrimination for subtle biomarker-specific traits
- Outperformance of traditional CNN and transformer models in NSCLC classification tasks

## Applications

- Early and accurate NSCLC diagnosis
- Personalized treatment planning
- Assistive tool for radiologists and oncologists
